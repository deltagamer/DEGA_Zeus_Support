DEGA: Zeus Support Modification
==============

![AH99E Front View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deltagamer/DEGA_Zeus_Support/main/Release_Notes/zeussupporticondark.png)

Features
=========
* Vanilla Support
* TIOW2 Drop pods
* RHS, GM and IFA3 Paratroopers
* Supply drops via plane
* Vehicle Drops via plane
* Glider drops when IFA3 mod is loaded
* UGV airdrop insertions

Whats Planned
=========

* A UI interface that allows you to select what vehicle / ammobox to airdrop. Currently just randomised between set values.
* Also another UI interface to allow you to select what infantry units to spawn as it is also random between set values.
* Cup support, however only once I figure out a solution to why when certain addons aren't loaded the classnames still appear.

I'm not capable of doing all this however! My scripting skills is very poor and I only managed to scrape this mod together, please if you're any good with that stuff perhaps get involved and help out. My vision is to have this give zeus a feeling of more like an RTS game.
